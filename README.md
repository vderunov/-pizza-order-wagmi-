# Pizza Order (Ethereum Pet Project: RainbowKit + Viem + Wagmi)

## Description

In this implementation of the Pizza Order project, we are transitioning from using low-level **ethers.js** 
on the client side to a more modern and upper-level technology stack: **RainbowKit**, **Viem**, and **Wagmi**. 
This move noticeably reduces boilerplate and provides us with convenient features for request status tracking, 
made possible primarily by @tanstack/react-query. Additionally, we benefit from TypeScript support and RainbowKit's 
exceptional wallet management with minimal coding and stylization. Not to mention, 
Wagmi's abundant hooks highlight the elegance of our application based on React.

## Key Technologies

**RainbowKit**: A React library designed to streamline the integration of wallet connectivity in your decentralized application (dapp). It offers intuitive, responsive, and customizable features.

**Viem**: A TypeScript Interface for Ethereum that delivers stateless primitives primed for seamless interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.

**Wagmi**: A lightweight library that introduces reactivity to Ethereum-based applications, simplifying the process of tracking state changes and reactive data updates.
